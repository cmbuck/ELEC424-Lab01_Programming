Lab01: Programming in a Linux Environment

Part 1

Q1. What were the arguments passed to the chmod command in (3)?
The arguments passed were "751 justifytext.py".

Q2. Copy-paste the directories in your path, and the contents of the directory where you placed the symbolic link as printed out by ls -l.
/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

Part 2

Q3. What operations are done on the input integer?
right shift by one: 	shrb -0x4(%rbp)
mask the lowest nibble:	andb $0xf,-0x4(%rbp)
left shift 4 bits:	shlb $0x4,-0x4(%rbp)

Q4. What is the present bug, and under what conditions is it triggered? 
The bug is the assignment of read only memory by way of attempting to modify one of the letters in the "error or not?" string.  The instruction "movb $0x45,(%rax)" is the offending instruction.  It is triggered if the product of shifting right by one, masking the lower nibble, and left shifting by 4 bits is greater than 128.

Q5. What are possible ways to fix this bug?
If the string was placed instead into stack memory, then the segfault would not occur.  This may be accomplished by using an array instead of a pointer.
"x[] = "error or not?".  Alternatively, not re-assigning x[0] at all would resolve the bug too.

Part 3

Q6. What is the maximum length array our program can sort?
Sizes up to and including 100 should and do work.  However, in one test an array length of 86 was confirmed to work.  87 and the printed result is incorrect, and higher lengths produce a segfault.

Q7. What is the difference between incrementing int* and char* by 1 (i.e. ((int *)p)+1) vs ((char *)p)+1))?
The first increments p by sizeof(int) bytes, and the second increments p by sizeof(char) bytes.

Q8. Are the input arrays passed by reference or value to merge_sort?
By reference.

Q9. What is the difference between #include "header.h" and #include <header.h>?
The preprocessor will search in different locations.  With quotes, it will search in the local directory and with angle brackets it will search in system library paths.

Q10. Use your justifytext script to justify this writeup (after completing it) to a length of 80 characters.
