Lab01: Programming in a Linux Environment
Christopher Buck

Part 1

Q1. What were the arguments passed to the chmod command in (3)?
The arguments passed were "751 justifytext.py".

Q2. Copy-paste the directories in your path, and the contents of the directory where you placed the symbolic link as printed out by ls -l.
/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

Part 2

Q3. What operations are done on the input integer?
right shift by one: 	shrb -0x4(%rbp)
mask the lowest nibble:	andb $0xf,-0x4(%rbp)
left shift 4 bits:	shlb $0x4,-0x4(%rbp)

Q4. What is the present bug, and under what conditions is it triggered? 
The bug is the assignment of read only memory by way of attempting to modify one of the letters in the "error or not?" string.  The instruction "movb $0x45,(%rax)" is the offending instruction

Q5. What are possible ways to fix this bug?
If the string was placed instead into stack memory, then the segfault would not occur.  This may be accomplished by using an array instead of a pointer.
"x[] = "error or not?"

Part 3

Q6. What is the maximum length array our program can sort?

Q7. What is the difference between incrementing int* and char* by 1 (i.e. ((int *)p)+1) vs ((char *)p)+1))?

Q8. Are the input arrays passed by reference or value to merge_sort?

Q9. What is the difference between #include "header.h" and #include <header.h>?

Q10. Use your justifytext script to justify this writeup (after completing it) to a length of 80 characters.
